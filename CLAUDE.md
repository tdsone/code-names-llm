# Project Description

Our app is a digital implementation of the card game code names with a twist: instead of 4 humans playing against each other in two teams, each human teams up with a language model which is called via the respective API.

# Implementation

We are using a frontend-backend split with types and utils shared in the /shared folder. The frontend is built in react (vite build system) and uses Typescript. The backend uses typescript as well and relies on a node express web server. Our main component system is shadcn.
